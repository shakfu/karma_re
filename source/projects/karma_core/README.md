# karma_core

The karma looper DSP, extracted out of Max so it can be reused in other
projects (CLI tools, other plugin formats, etc.). No Max/MSP headers — the host
supplies the sample buffer through a small callback interface
(`karma_buffer_iface`); the Max external becomes a thin shell over this core.

## Files

- `karma_core.h` — public API: the state struct (`t_karma`), control methods
  (`karma_record` / `karma_play` / `karma_overdub` / ...), and the per-vector
  `karma_{mono,stereo,quad}_perform` routines, plus `karma_core_init` /
  `karma_core_set_dims`.
- `karma_core.c` — **hand-owned source**. Originally extracted verbatim from the
  reference, now refactored directly. Edit it freely as long as the harness
  stays green. Holds the control methods, the perform engine, and init/configure;
  includes the kernel headers below. The reference's three near-identical
  perform routines (mono/stereo/quad) are unified into one channel-generic
  `karma_perform` that loops over `min(buffer, output)` channels; the three
  public `karma_*_perform` entry points are thin forwarders to it.
- `karma_state.h` — named enums for the control/perform state machine
  (`statecontrol` / `recfadeflag` / `playfadeflag` / `recendmark` / `statehuman`),
  replacing the reference's magic ints value-for-value.
- `karma_interp.h` — buffer-read interpolation kernels: the LINEAR/CUBIC/SPLINE
  macros and `interp_index` (the four-neighbour index/wrap math).
- `karma_ipoke.h` — record/ipoke write kernels: `ease_record`, `ease_switchramp`,
  `ease_bufoff`, `ease_bufon` (record fades + buffer declick). Both kernel headers
  are `static inline` and included by `karma_core.c` after `karma_core.h`.
- `gen_core.sh.orig` — the historical generator (retired). It was scaffolding to
  reach a *verified* extraction of the DSP helpers, control methods, and the
  mono/stereo/quad perform routines from `../karma_tilde/karma~.c`, rewriting only
  the Max dependencies (buffer~ access → the host interface; list-outlet/clock UI
  plumbing → elided). Kept for reference only; `karma_core.c` is no longer
  regenerated.

## Correctness

`karma_core.c` is held to a sample-exact bar: the offline harness in
`../../../tests/` runs the reference `karma~.c` and this core through an
identical battery of scenarios and diffs their output + final buffer. They
currently match exactly for mono, stereo, and quad. After any change to the core,
run `make check` in `tests/` and keep it green.

## Headers

- `karma_core_api.h` — the public API (struct, buffer interface, function
  declarations). Integer DSP state uses the standard `int64_t` (the header pulls
  in `<stdint.h>`); include this **after** the host's remaining scalar types
  (`t_bool` / `t_object`): the real c74 headers in a Max host, or `karma_core.h`
  in the standalone build.
- `karma_core.h` — the standalone build config: Max-free scalar typedefs, no-op
  UI/clock shims, then `#include "karma_core_api.h"`. Only `karma_core.c`
  includes this (along with the kernel headers above).

## Using it in a host

```c
karma_core_init(x, ochans, sample_rate, vector_size);
x->bufio = (karma_buffer_iface){ .lock=..., .unlock=..., .set_dirty=...,
                                 .ctx=..., .frames=..., .chans=..., .sr=... };
karma_core_set_dims(x);
// per control message: karma_record(x) / karma_overdub(x, amp) / ...
// per audio vector:    karma_mono_perform(x, NULL, ins, nins, outs, nouts, n, 0, NULL);
```

The Max external `../karma_re_tilde/karma_re~.c` is the reference host: a thin
shell that wraps a `karma_core` and backs the buffer interface with a Max
`buffer~`. It is validated against the original `karma~` sample-for-sample by the
offline harness in `../../../tests/` (`make shelldiff`).
